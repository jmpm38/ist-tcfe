\section{Introduction}

For the second experimental activity in the Circuit Theory and Electronics Fundamentals course, we were given a RC circuit to analyse.
This circuit is constituted by a sinusoidal voltage source $v_s$, dependent voltage $V_d$ and current $I_b$ sources, a capacitor $C$ and 7 resistors (fig. \ref{intro}).

The theoretical analysis (Section \ref{sec:analysis}) adresses, sequencially, the nodal analysis, then the calculus of $R_{eq}$. With these results, the natural response of the circuit, the forced response are computed, and then superimposed.

The simulation analysis (Section \ref{simuanal}) was made to validate the results obtained in section \ref{sec:analysis}, operating point, transient and then frequency analysis were made in Ngspice.
The conclusions of this study are outlined in the final section (\ref{resan}).

The voltage source varies in time as it follows:



\begin{equation}
v_s(t) = V_s u(-t) + sin(2\pi ft)u(t)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
u(t)=\begin{cases} 0, \quad t<0 \\ 1, \quad t \geq 0  \end{cases}
\end{equation}


To obtain the initial data, we ran a python script provided by our teacher, which generated the following data:\\
