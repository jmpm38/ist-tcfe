\section{Introduction}

For the third experimental activity in the Circuit Theory and Electronics Fundamentals course, we had to design and analyse an AC/DC converter circuit. In order to do it, the group chose the architecture of both the Envelope Detector and Voltage Regulator circuits. The circuit is shown in the image below.

In the first part of the circuit we use a transformer to decrease the voltage, then we use a full-wave rectifier circuit, using four diodes, and finally we have the Envelope Detector and Voltage Regulator circuits. With this configuration we pretend to obtain an output voltage at the desired value (12V), with the minimum variations.
