\section{Conclusion}
\label{resan}
All analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool.
To conclude, we believe that the main goal of the task proposed was achieved. Considering the output voltage and the ripple voltage of the regulator, in both theoretical and simulation analyses, we agreed that an accurate solution to this problem was reached. This solution was not only accurate but at the same time a very cheap solution, as you can see by the merit function. So, a good quality- cost balance was found. Overall this solution was a very successful one.
