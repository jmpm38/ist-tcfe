\section{Conclusion}
\label{resan}
All analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool.
As we can see the both theorical and simulation results match for every single component of the circuit. Even though we could have expected a bigger error margin due to the number of circuit components and the number of steps to get to final awnser, that was not the case. Hence, the circuit analysis proposed in the introduction was achieved.
