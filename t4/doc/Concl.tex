\section{Conclusion}
\label{resan}
In this laboratory assignment we were able to deepen our knowledge regarding BJT's and its applicability in various devices, in our case, an Audio Amplifier. 
As a conclusion we can state that the results of Ngspice and Octave differ. This was expected as we used non-linear components, the transistors, in the circuit and they were replaced in the incremental analysis by two resistances and a dependent current source (linear components).
To conclude, we believe that the main goal of the task proposed was achieved as we reached a high gain and large enough bandwidth to cover the human earing capacity.  Overall this solution was a very successful one.
