\section{Conclusion}
\label{resan}
In this laboratory assignment we were able to deepen our knowledge regarding OP-AMPs and its applicability in various devices, in our case, to design a passband filter.
Our objetive was to maximise the voltage gain within a certain frequency range, spending as little as possible on the components used. Overall, we were satisfied with the obtained results.
Nonetheless, it is important to mention that there was some mismatch between what we expected theoretically, and what was obtained in the simulation. These variations are mainly due to the non-linearity of the components, such as the OP-AMP. There were several parameters that were overlooked in the theoretical analysis, and are most likely the cause of the discrepancies.
